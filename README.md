## Reddenings, distances and luminosities of a new sample of Galactic Cepheids for probing the Milky Way and calibrating the extra-galactic distance scale

Extinction : Interstellar dust particles present in the line of sight of a star scatters the incoming light of shorter wavelength, making the target star appear redder (skewed to longer wavelength). It is called extinction. It is measured in a dimensionless unit called magnitude and denoted by A_v for visual band.
A_V = V - V_0, 
where V is visual apparent magnitude, and V_0 is true visual apparent magnitude


Reddening: Difference between any two observational bands gives the color of a star, i.e. B-V (blue band and visual band). If the true color of the star is (B-V)_0 then reddening is given by the relation:
E(B-V) = (B-V) - (B-V)_0 = A_B - A_V = difference of extinction


Distance: when the distance of stars measured in a lograthmic scale, it is called as distance modulus. Its unit is called as magnitude and represented by a greek letter, µ 
µ = m - M = 5*log(d/10pc), where d is distance in the unit of parsec


Luminosity: It is a measurement of radiant flux of a star, also measured in lograthmic unit - magnitude.


The three entities, reddening, distance and absolute luminostiy related by observation parameter, apparent magnitude as :
m = M + µ + R_v*E(B-V)
 where m is apparent magnitude (which we observe), M is absolute magnitude (luminosity of star at 10 pc distace, R_v is called reddening ratio, with value of 3.23


Cepheid: Special kind of stars which pulsates radially with a fixed period, and vary luminosity periodically. There is a linear relation between period of Cepheids and their luminosity. It is called PL relation or Leavitt law (1908). This relation is used for determining extragalactic distances.

In my thesis project, I am improving the measures of absolute magnitude of Galactic Cephieds using multi-band photometry data and distance modulus with given R_v = 3.23. If there is error in estimated reddening, drived absolute magnitude of Cepheids would contain error too. Also, incorrect distance modulus will contribute to wrong absolute magnitude. Error in absolute magnitude increase the width of PL relation, means higher uncertainity when determining extragalctic distances.

By improving the absolute magnitude, width of PL relation can be reduce. Distances derived from PL relation can be used as primary distances to calibrate other distance determination methods, like Type 1a supernova method. 

Precise extragalactic distances would help to estimate more reliable measurement of Hubble constant, so the age of the universe.
